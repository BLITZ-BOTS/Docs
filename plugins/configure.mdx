<Info>
Some plugins may not have config.
</Info>

There are 2 ways to install a plugin, through the [Controller App](/installation/controller) or through an [IDE](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide).

## IDE
To edit a plugins config, locate the plugins folder inside of the ``/plugins`` directory.

You will then need to find the plugins ``blitz.config.yaml`` file.

To edit the config, all you need to do is update it's value inside of the plugins config file.

### Example blitz.config.yaml
```yaml blitz.config.yaml
name: my_plugin
description: My totally cool plugin
version: 1.0.0

config:
    cool_message: "This is a cool message"
```

This basic example of a blitz.config.yaml file contains a config key called ``cool_message``. Currently the value is ``This is a cool message``.

```yaml blitz.config.yaml {6}
name: my_plugin
description: My totally cool plugin
version: 1.0.0

config:
    cool_message: "This is an updated config message!"
```
After updating the config file, the new value for ``cool_message`` would be ``This is an updated config message!``.
